The presence of trains in Jhumpa Lahiri's The Namesake is both pervasive and,
upon appearance, unsettling. By the end of the book, the symbolism practically
bounds out of the pages, weaving itself through the climax about as subtly as a
train might. It is at this climax that Gogol finds out, sitting across from his
wife Moushumi on a train, that she has been having an affair. And yet, the book
narrates it with the air of something not much more significant than a
footnote, a detail worth mentioning but not worth the effort of constructing a
scene complete with a dialogue. "It had been on the train, exactly a year ago
that he'd learned of Moushumi's affair", the telling begins, ending swiftly in
a couple paragraphs with a description of Gogol awestruck by Venician
architecture on his vacation. It is in this slightly resigned fashion with
which the book conducts its story (helped by the present progressive, third
person omniscient style of the narration), along with the consistent presence of
trains, that it reveals its underlying message. Trains in The Namesake appear
to represent the inevitable, unstoppable forward progression of life, with all
the critical events that, for better or worse, we must experience within it.

Returning to the few paragraphs describing Gogol's discovery of Moushumi's
affair, we see that the train setting plays an explicit role in the way the
climactic reveal unfolds. That Gogol is trapped in a traincar with a wife he no
longer loves, and who no longer loves him, barreling towards a Christmas with
a mother and sister who Moushumi no longer deserves to see, serves to amplify
the grating sense of destiny Gogol experiences
