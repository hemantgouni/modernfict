The presence of trains in Jhumpa Lahiri's The Namesake is both pervasive and,
upon appearance, unsettling. By the end of the book, the symbolism practically
bounds out of the pages, weaving itself through the climax about as subtly as a
train might. It is at this climax that Gogol finds out, sitting across from his
wife Moushumi on a train, that she has been having an affair. And yet, the book
narrates it with the air of something not much more significant than a
footnote, a detail worth mentioning but not worth the effort of constructing a
scene complete with a dialogue. "It had been on the train, exactly a year ago
that he'd learned of Moushumi's affair", the telling begins, ending swiftly in
a couple paragraphs with a description of Gogol awestruck by Venician
architecture on his vacation (Lahiri 259). It is in this slightly resigned
fashion with which the book conducts its story (helped by the present
progressive, third person omniscient style of the narration), along with the
consistent presence of trains, that it reveals its underlying message. Trains
in The Namesake appear to represent the inevitable, unstoppable forward
progression of life, with all the critical events that, for better or worse, we
must experience within it.

Returning to the few paragraphs describing Gogol's discovery of Moushumi's
affair, we see that the train setting plays an explicit role in the way the
climactic reveal unfolds. That Gogol is trapped in a traincar with a wife he no
longer loves, and who no longer loves him, barreling towards a Christmas with a
mother and sister who Moushumi no longer deserves to see, serves to amplify the
grating sense of closure Gogol experiences. That is, the events of the passage
represent the inevitable conclusion of the scattered pieces of evidence
throughout the past several months of their marriage, with Gogol "feel[ing] the
chill of her secrecy [...] he remembered a night weeks ago; looking through her
bag [...] he'd pulled out her diaphragm case" (Lahiri 259). We can see that the
train acts to bind Gogol to this revelation, forcing him to face it.
Furthermore, because he must play the part of a happy husband at the Christmas
party to which the train is taking him, we can see that the train explicitly
forces him to begin to move past the destruction of his marriage.

We see another few examples of the significance of trains during Gogol's
undergraduate years at Yale. On one particular instance, Gogol meets his first
partner, Ruth, reflecting years later that "boarding the train it is impossible
not to think of the afternoon [...] they'd met" (Lahiri 114). On another, the
train stops for an hour because "a suicide had been committed, a person had
jumped in front of the train" (Lahiri 114). These events are not worth
mentioning because they are individually significant, as the last one was, but
because they reinforce the connection between the symbolism of trains and the
unstoppable progression of life. More specifically, both of these events
represent a critical phase of life: the former, a first relationship, and the
latter, straightforwardly, death. In both cases, the nature of the train plays
an essential role. In the first, the confined, chaotic character of the train
in bringing together
