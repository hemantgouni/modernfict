(we maybe should have written this on 'poo tee weet?')

war:

-> "i know i know i know"

-> glacier quote (protesting war is like protesting a glacier)

-> billy watching war movie backwards

-> tralfamadorians lecturing billy about war and its inevitability

-> wife of o'hare commenting that the book will glorify war; author (vonnegut?)
   promising that it will not

-> billy crying at having hurt horses (but not anything else in the war)

-> more?

The grotesque images of war brought to life in Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five reach a head in the final few pages of the book, in which Billy Pilgrim, the book's unlikely hero, retreives the bodies of dead civilians from the ruins of Dresden. Among the bomb wrought pits Billy compares to the surface of the moon, there are "hundreds of corpse mines operating [...] the bodies rotted and liquefied, and the stink was like roses and mustard gas" (97). These scenes, however, stand in sharp contrast to those which with they are quickly replaced. The reader is whisked into the happier, hopeful, calm of the end of the war, with the recent witnesses of its stomach-lurching realities swiftly moving away from the past. The whiplash-worthy storytelling at the end of the book betrays, as a war novel, its message: that war is as inevitable as it is horrible.

This is emphasized by a conversation from several pages prior between Billy and his post-plane-crash hospital roommate Professor Rumfoord, the official historian of the Army Air Force. Rumfoord says to Billy about the attack on Dresden that "it had to be done [...] that's war", and Billy replies with "I know. I'm not complaining".  Rumfoord continues, saying that "[Billy] must have had mixed feelings, there on the ground", and Billy again retorts in his usual, aloof manner with "It was all right. Everything is all right, and everybody has to do exactly what he does" (90). The detached air with which Billy relates his disposition, if it can even be said that he has one, on the most traumatic sequence of events of his life alludes to an acceptance of the fateful finality of the whole ordeal. He knows, better than most, the gruesome realities of war, yet at the same time cannot help but stand by as destiny unfolds. The grating contradiction between Billy's apathy towards the war and the terrible acts he observes within it serves to demonstrate Vonnegut's own acknowledgement of the brutal realities of war, while at the same time revealing an existential apprehension about his (lack of) control over any of it.

This analysis of the author's perspective on war is granted further purchase retroactively, when Billy throws himself before the Tralfamadorians with a rousing speech-- or so he thinks. He professes that "Earthlings must be the terrors of the Universe", describing the toll of war on Earth and imploring the Tralfamadorians to "tell [him] the secret so [he] can take it back to Earth and save [them] all: How can a planet live at peace?". Billy's unmoved audience informs him that Earthlings, for all their senseless slaughter, are not special-- that even they, as a nearly omniscient alien species, "have wars as horrible as any you've seen or read about" (54). In light of the vivid pictures of war painted in the final chapters of the book, alongside Billy's acute indifference towards them, the reader is left in retrospect to conclude that these bloody pictures are a fundamental truth-- if even beings who perceive all time at once have resigned themselves to them, then humans truly have no chance, and never did. Vonnegut's commentary here evokes a powerful feeling of powerlessness for the reader, likely mirroring his own during, and following, the war. Simultaneously, however, not all is lost; at the conclusion of its conversation with Billy, the Tralfamadorian impresses upon him to "ignore the awful times, and concentrate on the good ones" (54). Just as in the final few pages of the book, where among the smoking ruins of Dresden, stunned soldiers find a glimmer of hope in the ability for the nature to recover and turn to happier times, humanity as a whole may find solace at their finer points. A close reading, again in retrospect, shows that Vonnegut's attitude towards war is not as somber and resigned as it may initially seem; rather, he strongly believes that human happiness will persist despite the terrific acts of violence they enact against each other. The reader, their hopes for a world without war dashed, are left with this consolation prize.

A final instance of commentary on war occurs within the first chapter of the book, when Vonnegut is talking to a friend of his (Harrison Starr) about his anti-war book, Slaughterhouse Five. Harrison asks why he isn't writing an anti glacier book instead, with which Vonnegut sympathizes, monologuing that "[wars are] as easy to stop as glaciers" (7). This downright gloomy outlook is granted a chance at redemption in the face of the rest of the novel. We see, in hindsight, that this is certainly not the whole of Vonnegut's perspective on war-- we are well acquainted with the creeping, absolute truth of it introduced by this quote, but also, by the final chapter, with the hope that lies in the miraculous human ability to persevere around and beyond it. We see that this quote is not a condemnation of human nature, but one piece of a horrible, wonderful puzzle that is the collective human experience.
